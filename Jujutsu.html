    <h1>Jujutsu Kaisen</h1>
    <p>Jujutsu Kaisen is one of my favorite and first animes. I didnt like to watch anime back then, I only got curious because of my uncle and cousin who are hardcore fans of animes like my hero acadamia. Jujutsu was one of the animes they recommended and I liked it because of how goofy it was and because of the fighting scenes.</p>
    <p>My favorite character is Gojo Satoru because he is hilarious and powerful at the same time.</p>
